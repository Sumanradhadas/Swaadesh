You are improving a static personal portfolio website project named “WebGlow”.

TASKS:

1. **Overall Style & Modernization**
   - Make the design visually modern, consistent, and sleek — similar to 2025 portfolio design trends.
   - Use dark mode theme (navy / black with soft glow).
   - Add subtle glassmorphism or neon glow effects to buttons, nav, and cards.
   - Use smooth scroll animations and hover transitions (via CSS or AOS library).
   - Ensure fully responsive and mobile-friendly design.

2. **Header Enhancement**
   - In the header (navbar area), add a small, elegant text or logo credit:
     “✨ Powered by WebGlow”  
     — clicking on it should open: https://webglowx.onrender.com/ in a new tab.
   - Keep it subtle and beautiful (not overpowering main nav).
   - Fix the “Samakarn” font issue — it loads slowly and visibly shifts make it quick. 


3. **Footer Fix + Unification**
   - Currently, different pages have different footers. Unify them across all pages.
   - Footer text should read:
     “Designed & Developed by WebGlow”  
     — “WebGlow” should be a clickable link (https://webglowx.onrender.com/).
   - Add smooth hover effect and matching glow styling Web(blue) Glow(orange). 

4. **Performance & UX**
   - Optimize images and fonts for faster load.
   - Add meta tags for SEO and social preview.
   - Ensure consistent color palette and component spacing.
   - Validate all internal links and fix any broken routes.

5. **Technical Notes**
   - This is a static site currently hosted on GitHub, imported into Replit.
   - Keep the project structure clean and modular (components for header/footer if possible).
   - Do not use heavy frameworks — pure HTML, CSS, JS, or lightweight libraries only.
